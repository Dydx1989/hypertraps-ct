Let's finally get this all together.

We have synthetic test cases and real-world examples.

The real-world examples are MRO and TB. Both these start with a tree and some barcodes. Initial steps in Python and C turn these into source data.
In the MRO case there are two trees: one (untimed) from NCBI and one (timed) from TimeTree. Different scripts cook these into HyperTraPS-ready data.

Process:/
  prune-tree.py -- reduces a tree to just those nodes in a barcode datafile
  internal-labels.c -- includes dummy internal node labels to suit some software
  parse-new.py -- infers internal node barcodes and produces transition datafiles
  cook-data.sh -- applies these steps to given data. good for TB and MRO-NCBI; MRO-TimeTree needs more curation
  mro-timetree-parse.sh -- take care of MRO-TimeTree

RawData/:
  ng.2878-S2.txt -- tuberculosis phylogeny from Casali et al.
  tuberculosis-v5-header-19-29.csv -- tuberculosis traits from Casali et al.
  mro-barcodes.csv -- MRO traits compiled from meta-analysis (mro-metaanalysis.ods)
  mro-ncbi-tree.phy -- MRO taxonomy tree from NCBI's Common Taxonomy Tree
  mro-timetree-species.txt -- species list of things that are in TimeTree
  Eukaryota_species.nwk -- TimeTree phylogeny (that doesn't contain all our species of interest!)

Tests/:
  generate.c -- generate synthetic datasets

Inference/:
  hypertraps-all.c -- HyperTraPS code
